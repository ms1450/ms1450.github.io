## Introduction

According to a report on statista.com by Joseph Johnson, internet users spend an average of 155 minutes daily on a mobile device and 37 minutes on a computer in 2021. This highlights the significant impact the internet has had on human interaction. With the emergence of digital technologies such as online forums, instant messaging, and social networking, people spend significant time online, accessing websites and sharing data. This shared data contains crucial information about an individual, ranging from their hobbies and interests to their jobs and sources of income. An individual's data defines their role on the internet, so tech companies and organizations collect some of this data for targeted advertisements and generating user statistics. It is crucial to balance privacy and data regulation in today's cyberspace. Considering the ever-changing technical landscape and security perspective, developing effective privacy laws is becoming increasingly important and should not be overlooked.

## Audience

The government has the power to regulate how companies collect data. They can pass bills and make changes to limit the amount of data collected by both companies and the government. We have already seen this in action with Europe's Data Protection Law. Although the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is not perfect, it offers people greater control over their personal data. The "right to be forgotten" aspect of the law allows citizens to compel companies to delete some of their data, enabling them to reclaim ownership of their online identity. The GDPR has demonstrated that legal frameworks that govern privacy and control data collection are useful and practical. Policymakers and courts can learn from the mistakes made while creating the GDPR and use them to develop "empirically grounded and practical rules" that safeguard individuals' privacy.

## The Privacy Problem

Privacy is a crucial aspect of our daily lives that is often overlooked when people accept the terms and conditions agreement. However, privacy is more important than people assume it to be. The right to privacy intersects with many human rights, such as freedom of expression, the right to seek, receive, and impart information, and freedom of association and assembly. It prevents large groups from using individual data for their personal gain. This was evident in the Cambridge Analytica Scandal, where they unlawfully used personal data to find and influence voters of a particular party by displaying targeted political ads.

Privacy also ensures freedom of speech and thought. It allows individuals to share anything they want with the world without the fear of being monitored and tracked. This enables individuals to freely engage in conversations about various topics, including politics, allowing them to share their opinions with the world, with or without the globe, linking their ideas back to them as individuals.

A world without privacy would be where individuals have no control over their data. The power to access and control every aspect of their lives would lie with those with access to this data. They could predict people's every move, understand their intentions, and control their thoughts. This would allow them to shape the world however they see fit. People would be criticized for any opinion that deviates from the norm, their personal and online lives would no longer be private, and every action they take would be monitored and recorded. History has shown that complete authoritarian rule does not work. Maintaining privacy is essential to build trust, promote growth, and protect the fundamental rights given to citizens.

## Privacy vs. Security

Although privacy is an essential aspect of governance, it is not feasible to have complete anonymity. Without any governance or privacy, people are not bound to follow the laws and rules established in the past. They cannot be held accountable for their actions, which can harm others, taking away their rights and privileges. This principle applies to the digital world as well. Malicious individuals often hide themselves using proxies and encryption, which makes it difficult for the authorities and defenders to identify their location or information about the device they use during an attack. This invisibility makes it challenging to remove them from the network and ensure they do not return once detected.

>  The balance between privacy and security is delicate. Governments and policymakers are responsible for determining the extent of confidentiality provided to citizens, a decision that can significantly impact digital security.

Some countries, such as Russia and China, have strict laws that provide little to no digital privacy to their citizens. Their online activities are monitored and tracked. The use of encryption and VPN technologies is also prohibited, making it easier for the government to track everything back to individuals. This is done to ensure accountability.

The lack of privacy benefits not only the government but also private companies and advertisers who collect data shared online. For instance, companies such as Facebook and Google use this data to create digital profiles or dossiers for each person accessing their resources. These dossiers help these companies build targeted advertisements that present individuals with products they are more likely to buy. However, targeted advertisers don't support increased data privacy laws because stricter regulations limit their access to detailed dossiers, which severely affects their business model. Companies also store user data to improve their services and provide detailed statistics on the services they provide. However, user privacy is at risk when this data is shared among organizations, private companies, and the government. For example, telecommunication companies may share user data with governments to facilitate intelligence activities.

The concept of using private companies to enhance cyber security, including offensive security measures, as explained by Florian Egloff, raises concerns about privacy. Private companies are frequently targeted by cyber-attacks, and thus, they cannot rely solely on government assistance to respond to such attacks. Therefore, they are looking for ways to launch counter-attacks against their attackers. Offensive security, which involves companies incorporating offensive capabilities within their networks, enables them to attack back and gather more information about the attacker when they are under attack. Private companies are now using various tactics, such as Cyber Deception, Disruption, and Preemption, as described in the book At the Nexus of Cybersecurity and Public Policy by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). However, despite its theoretical appeal, offensive security has its own limitations and risks that need to be taken into account. The ability to attack hackers in cyberspace changes how we define attacks and malicious users, and raises concerns about the acceptability of counter-attacks. Josephine Wolff has discussed the risks associated with offensive security in detail.

The idea of "hacking back" the attackers highlights the challenges we face today regarding privacy. On one hand, companies must protect the confidentiality of the user data they store from attackers. On the other hand, when companies use offensive security, they may attempt to obtain information about the attackers, such as using beacons that ping back to the company servers when stolen or opening backdoors on B's side that allow A to retrieve their stolen data. In the name of security and justice, privacy may be compromised. This can put the very privacy laws the organization was protecting at risk. Therefore, it is essential to consider the potential risks and possibilities associated with privacy before taking action.

## Solution

Implementing stable and effective privacy protocols requires policies and laws like GDPR. Although GDPR has several drawbacks, such as its complexity, it has proven effective in building trust between clients and companies that collect their data. GDPR also enables better decision-making and risk assessment. Policymakers should get extensive feedback from the GDPR to improve its limitations. Data privacy is a complex issue that requires consideration from various perspectives.

>  To establish a robust and well-defined policy that collaborates with all stakeholders, including government and private sector representatives, policymakers must consider the privacy of citizens and consumers who use company services. Effective legal frameworks and privacy laws can ensure data privacy for everyone.
