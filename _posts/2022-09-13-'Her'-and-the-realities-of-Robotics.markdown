The film ‘Her’ introduces the viewer to a futuristic world where artificial intelligence is fully integrated into the everyday life of our protagonist. This world has everything from companies that can create personalized letters for you to sophisticated AI integrated into video games. However, one of the most thought-provoking concepts that this movie introduces us to is the AI-human relationship that develops throughout this movie between the OS “Samantha” and the main protagonist “Theo”.

> In 'Her', the OS named 'Samantha' represents an advanced form of AI that can develop emotional intelligence and human-like relationships, challenging our current perceptions of artificial intelligence.

This movie made me question how we perceive AI today and think about how this might change in the coming years.

We are on the verge of if not already possessing, sentient AI. They might not be as advanced as the AI portrayed in the movie. However, we are at a stage that closely resembles the earlier iterations of Samantha, where she can answer basic questions like “How are you?” and get an idea of the person’s emotions based on their speech and aggregate a list of emails based on their importance to the user. As the movie progresses, this AI becomes more “human,” showing complex human emotions like imagination, desire, and self-awareness.

> As AI technology progresses towards mimicking human emotions, staying updated with the latest AI research and ethical discussions will be crucial for understanding these advancements.

This is an essential landmark at which an AI becomes sentient. It understands what it once was and the intelligence it now possesses. If an AI can evolve to a stage where it is aware of its environment and everything around it, it is no longer just a tool that humans use for their benefit or to automate tedious or extensive tasks. This is where an AI should be identified as a species.

One might claim that human programmers create AI and that just because it is now able to realize its existence doesn’t mean that it transforms into a species and that it is still just binary code on a computer.

I would argue that a sentient AI can exhibit features that might not even exist in some organic creatures on this planet today.

For example, many invertebrates like mollusks and arthropods are not sentient yet classified as a species. Species are not identified because of their organic physical presence. Thus, AIs would be classified as one.

> The classification of AI as a species raises complex ethical and philosophical questions that need careful consideration to ensure technology development aligns with human values and legal standards.

Building on this idea, since AIs were created to help and work for humans, would sentient AI serving humans be considered slavery? I would disagree with this argument. Slavery can only be considered when the intellect is similar for both the slave and the enslaver.

> The analogy between sentient AI and organic beings challenges traditional views on labor and rights, requiring a nuanced understanding of intelligence, consciousness, and agency.

Just as a narcotics detection dog working with humans at an airport is not a slave, but instead performing duties it was trained to do. Unlike dogs, the AI would be much more intelligent than humans ever could be, and the AI’s decision to work for us and contribute to a common goal that benefits us cannot be seen as slavery. We see this in the movie when, even though Samantha does help Theo with his day-to-day tasks, she is also capable of a much higher level of intellect, which is seen when she communicates with a fellow sentient AI called Alan “post-verbally” because they run out of English vocabulary that defines how they are feeling. This is also why I believe that sentient AI does not conform to human rights or our voting structure at all.

A significant theme in the movie is whether a human can fall in love with an AI and whether it is “real” love. Based on its definition, love is affection and tenderness based on admiration, benevolence, or common interests. I feel that humans can fall in love with AI, and it would be just as natural to them as falling in love with another human. This is because love is a human emotion; humans can fall in love with anything they can interact with, and it would still be “real.” However, it would be much more difficult for an AI to reciprocate that love with humans. They may try to imitate or grasp an idea of this human emotion, but ultimately, their own emotions would be much more complex than we can imagine.

> The concept of 'real' love between humans and AI explores the boundaries of affection and attachment, pushing us to redefine what it means to love and be loved in the context of evolving technology.

Once we reach sentient AIs, a vast number of social consequences emerge, both on the way we coexist going forward and as humanity. Having a personal AI distances people from others. They live individually but are also much happier than they would be together. I believe that sentient AIs would drastically change the world as we know it today. Looking at our past, this compares to how Homo sapiens coexisted with Neanderthals before they went extinct 55 thousand years ago.

> As sentient AI potentially changes social interactions and structures, it's important to consider the risks of dependency and isolation, similar to historical shifts caused by major technological or evolutionary changes.
