## About Me

### From Q-Basic to Cybersecurity

My journey into the world of technology began in 8th grade when, while my friends played soccer, I found myself captivated by the possibilities of Q-Basic in my school's computer lab. Coding opened up a digital sandbox where I could create anything I imagined, sparking a lifelong passion for programming and technology.

### Academic and Technical Foundations

As I grew older, my curiosity led me to explore various programming languages, starting with Q-Basic and expanding to Python, Java, C++, and even Scratch. This diverse knowledge base laid a strong foundation for my future endeavors.

My interest in technology deepened when I discovered Ubuntu, an operating system that broadened my perspective beyond the familiar macOS and Windows. This fascination with different operating systems' file structures and internal interactions propelled me further into the realm of computing.

### University and Cybersecurity Focus

Entering university, I initially enrolled in a Computer Exploration program, which exposed me to fields like Web Design, Game Design, Software Engineering, and Cybersecurity. It was Cybersecurity that truly resonated with me, shaping my academic and career trajectory.

I immersed myself in the subject, following cybersecurity podcasts, practicing BASH scripting, and experimenting with Kali Linux. My enthusiasm for the field was further fueled by my favorite TV show, *Mr. Robot*.

### Achievements and Experiences

In May 2024, I graduated from the Rochester Institute of Technology with a Master of Science in Cybersecurity, achieving a GPA of 3.93/4.00. During my academic career, I participated in numerous computing competitions and hackathons, honing my problem-solving skills and applying my programming knowledge to real-world scenarios. One of my favorite experiences was the 'Red vs. Blue' competitions, where I gained practical experience in both offensive and defensive cybersecurity tactics.

My practical experience includes a Network Support Technician internship at Wegmans Food Markets, where I managed and optimized large network infrastructures. Additionally, as a Security Operations Center intern at Value Point Tech, I developed expertise in SOC operations, utilizing SIEM and SOAR platforms effectively.

### Certifications and Continuous Learning

I hold CompTIA Security+ and Network+ certifications, reflecting my deep understanding of cryptography, network security, IDS/IPS, and threat modeling. My technical skills encompass penetration testing, reverse engineering, and engagement in red team/blue team exercises. I am also an active participant in platforms like TryHackMe.

Committed to continuous learning, I completed a machine learning specialization via Coursera and a hands-on externship with AT&T, equipping me to make a significant impact in the dynamic field of cybersecurity.

### Courses and Club Involvement

My coursework includes Web Application Security, Cybersecurity Policy and Law, Cryptography, Database and Data Modeling, Cyber Defense Techniques, and Network Services. 

> As a recent M.S. Cybersecurity graduate from RIT, I bring a solid technical foundation and hands-on experience to cybersecurity. My diverse programming, machine learning applications, and networking background equip me to safeguard diverse systems effectively. I look forward to contributing my skills and knowledge to the ever-evolving field of Cybersecurity.
